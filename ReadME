## 🧠 What it does

- Classifies skin lesion images into 7 classes using a CNN (`model.h5`)
- Uses GPT (via OpenAI API) to generate a natural language explanation for the prediction, including:
  - What it could mean
  - Risk level
  - What to do next

## 🧪 Example

Upload a photo of a skin lesion, and you'll get:

```
Prediction: MEL
Confidence: 87.52%

GPT Explanation:
This lesion has a high probability of being melanoma, which is a serious type of skin cancer. It is strongly advised to...
```

## 🔐 API Key

To use the GPT explanation feature, create an API key on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and set it in the `app.py` file:

```python
openai.api_key = "your_api_key_here"
```
